I ordered another sample few times ago. I don't know if i was remembering well or not but the chocolate flavor is gone this time... there are maybe some slight hints of cacao in the throat right after drinking, with honey and licorice or malt. I'm not able to describe how it tastes but i really like this tea and this kind of well rounded bulang. It dries the mouth a little but it doesn't last.
For me the qi was there: "satisfaction qi", relaxing, clears mind. Not an "euphoric qi" but i would probably put it in this category.... but well it's only a personal feeling.
