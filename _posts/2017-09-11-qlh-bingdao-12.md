0/ wet leaves: agressive like a bitter bulang but with musky notes, forest & spices
1/ wet leavers: spicey... nutty almost fruity
very pale golden soup
it's smooth and aromatic, slightly floral... the aroma is weak but persists quite a lot... that aroma and some creamy feelings defines the aftertaste ...  tjhe wholevery penetrating though
2/ the golden broth orange is getting orange hints
herbaceous and tobacco... huigan... soft and almost silky texture...
it's very subtle and penetrating, it's not a taste profile i'm used too but i like it.
some astringency shows up after like 3 minutes
qi is obvious and penetrating, brightness vision feelings and slight euphoria
there's a hint of perfume in the aftertaste, like in some mensong

i would not be suprised if this what a lincang blended with a certain percentage of bulang to give strength
