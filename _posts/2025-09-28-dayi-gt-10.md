Wet leaves smell just like Dragon Pole.

Cups 1 to 7: It starts with a creamy semolina note - right after it tastes rather close to the Dragon Pole '10 but thicker and less aromatic.\
The color is dark, the flavors are not bright; there is caramel, blackcurrant, some vanilla, and a tiny hint of coffee maybe.\
The aftertaste is a bit mineral and poor.

Afterward, I started enjoying it: it was still creamy but it became earthy with enjoyable chicken coop flavors; and a stable minerality.

It's rather close to the Dragon Pole '10 with less aroma and brightness; it's thick and creamy in the mouth, but the aftertaste is pretty poor.\
The early brews are not fantastic, yet very drinkable; the later ones shine more to me.
