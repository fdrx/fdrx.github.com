First zijuan tea for me tonight. very compressed and very cheap, i really enjoyed its simplicity: it tasted only bitter at the beginning, then appeared a hint of peach aroma and, after a few brews, a realistic almond paste flavor with a hint of melon. It's new experience that i enjoyed much more than my stomach did.
