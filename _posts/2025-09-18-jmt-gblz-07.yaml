GuangBieLaoZhai is all I like. 

After the rinse the leaves smell earthy but the first cup is insipid though its color is amber. 

Well that session is a big disillusion, it's like the tea is dead, it's hot water with flat puerh flavors, a 2D tea.
Is it the result of starting with wet storage and finishing with dry storage?
Wet storage was everyone's goal at the beginning of the 2010s, I thought the wet kick would be interesting to follow up over the years. Looks like no.

I don't know what to say, I need to retry this one, perhaps with a Yixing pot, and with more leaves, because I have brewed it until it's tasteless and it was a disaster.
