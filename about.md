<p>
    Between 2009 and 2012 my autism hit hard and I ended buying more than 75 kilos of puerh tea. Also I made some lists of villages and maps on Teachat (https://www.teachat.com/viewtopic.php?t=17948) in order to understanf a bit more about that tea.
    Living in the Meca of coffee i've slept in the coffee bed for years, and I'm reviting my puerh beengs.
