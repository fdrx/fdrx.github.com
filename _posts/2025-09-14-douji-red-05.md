Douji was pretty trendy at the beginning of the 2010s, but I'm not sure if it was earned. In my memory, this one is better than the Red 05 and the Daye 06, so let's see how it is now. I'm expecting a classic Yiwu taste, not much more.

The wet leaves indeed smell that typical Yiwu taste, like prunes and a sort of metallic milk, and a touch of incense, too.

The first cup is orange, and it is rather thick, having a bit of semolina and some classic Yiwu aromas.

The second cup is similar but with an orange-peel distant bitterness.

The third cup is woodier; the mouthfeel is quite poor and leaves the tongue raspy.

The next 2-3 cups are quite good cups, still some wood, prunes, and that metallic cream.

Around the seventh cup, some decent relaxing Qi is coming, just when the tea starts fading. I can feel it in the whole body, not only in the head; it might have built up a bit of muscle with the years.

When fading, it becomes mineral and camphorish.

It's not bad and it is possibly better than the Red 05 and the Daye 06 I need to revisit. Though I think the Red 05 is pretty similar.

Its main quality is the classic Yiwu taste. It's clean and decently durable, but just not very exciting to me. On top of that, the aftertaste and mouthfeel are rather poor. The Qi is decent though; I was not expecting much, and I enjoyed feeling a bit wasted.
