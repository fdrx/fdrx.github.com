    Between 2009 and 2013 I was obsessed with puerh. At that time my autism hit hard and I ended buying more than 150 pounds of puerh! Also I tried to make puerh areas maps and list of villages on <a href="https://www.teachat.com/viewtopic.php?t=17948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">TeaChat</a> so that I could understand a bit more about that tea and its production areas. I hope it helped not only myself. ...talk about rivers (licang)??...talk about not reading chinese??

    Living in the paradise of coffee, I cheated on my puerh affair and slept in the coffee bed for years, but now it's time to revisit my beengs.

    This site’s built with open-source tools: Github Pages, Jekyll and Staticman.
    The design’s a shameless nod to Medium (sorry, Medium, you’re just too inspiring!).
