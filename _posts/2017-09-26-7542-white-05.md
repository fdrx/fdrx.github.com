This is one of these white labels cakes that were produced for the dayi employees, it is supposed to have better material than the commercial version.

After a quick wash the wet leaves smell exquisite: ageness, camphor and butter biscuits. The first cup tastes sweet & delicious too, i can't drink it fast. That first cup tastes sweet like a yuwi, blended with other stuff, but who knows? The sweetness and the freshness stay in the mouth, there is no astingency. after a few minutes some sweetness sets at the top of the throat.

On round 2 the soup is getting more aromatic and agressive. The taste is also changing and more dominant, it's still quite sweet but it tastes like a camphor-ish banzhang more than a yiwu, to give an idea (not than i am used to drink camphor-ish banzhang very often though :). The body is full: earthy/soil tones, camphor, plum, caramel... The bitterness transforms into sweetness after a second. Some sweet butter and chenwei set all around the mouth and on the top of the throat along with some slow to come freshness.

Round 3, like round 2, it is a real pleasure to drink, even if i think that the durability should not be fantastic for this kind of teas, but we'll see... after only three cups i am feeling very satisfied, and pretty hungry too. Later i am having a small headache.

Round 4, the perfume from the leaves, right after the brew, is still mesmerizing me: wood with ageness, caramel, eucalyptus, a bit of smoke... The taste is still full and bz-ish to me: wood, camphor, ageness... The effect of the bitterness transforming immediatly into sweetness is a real school case : )
The aftertaste is really bold and dynamic, now some licorice is appearing, which is something i love; the sweetness goes and comes, that's impressive. still no astringency and an effective shengjin.

i will go back to that tomorrow, i have to go... my headache is still there but i don't care, i'm in love.

I have half a 7542 502 too, i should compare them once. It's also a hit from what i remember, but it has more a church incense taste profile, less strength and less durability.

I got the former in '12 for 350 rmb in promotion... and today, seriously, i'd like to cry in a fetal position to have only one. But thanks to my wine culture I console myself because i know that only drinking grands crus is the saddest and stupidest thing someone can do.
