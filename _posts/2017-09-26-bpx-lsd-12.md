0/ wet leaves: leather and hay. It tastes absolutely nothing, like hot water with a tiny pinch of sugar, and perhaps a little something mineral. The aftertaste has a distant sweet component.
There are strong leather aromas filling the room, which constrasts a lot with the mouth experience.

1/ wet leaves: leather and flowers. It tastes nothing, just hot water with tobacco and some very distant bitter cooking oil. The empty cup smells tobacco, candy and something floral, it’s pretty attractive. The aftertaste has a distant sweetness and something floral in the background, it is building though. After some minutes the salivation promotion starts and there is some coolness in the mouth, nothing outside the norms.
Stong aromas in the room : leather and candy, but the tea is really tasteless

2/ it tastes more lsd now even if it is still pretty muted… I have to wait for the soup to get colder to be able to spot the sweet butter & grass. The aftertaste is hatching out quickly and makes me think of a sweet bulang actually, it would be hard to make the difference, at this point, with some lbz-like teas. It is sweet, with a noble smoke component, some leather, some past bitterness; and a decent coolness in the mouth. the shengjin is effective.
the aromas in the room are still damned strong and yummy

3/ leather, candy in the room… still delicious for the nose.
the broth is oilier and cleaner, has dark gold color, it smells strong.
The taste is still quite insipid, tobacco is the most obvious component when the soup is warm. When it gets colder i can find butter and some distant candy.
The aftertaste has depth, and that depth lasts, but the aromatic persistency is weak, compared to some lbz, for instance

5/ tobacco is more present and is coming now along with cereals, it’s less bland. the aftertaste brings sugarcane and something floral that lasts. Still a very aromatic experience.
cooling is still there but in the average, nothing special

6/ tobacco, leather and some distant bitter citrus. At this point it makes me think of that douji ’06 daye, without the red tea processing. The aftertaste has citrus i believe. Some astringency is settling in the mouth but will remain moderate

7/ bitter grass, sweet oil, tobacco. When it’s cold the smoke component is more obvious.
Oddly i’m feeling qi and it’s very sudden: some confused thoughts in the head and an obvious body stone. The aftertaste has sugarcane which is now staying longer, along with some grapefuit but i’m not sure, can be floral… who cares anyway…

8/ The soup is becoming vegetal and bitter, like a dying sheng, there’s smoke and a hint of anise. the aromas are bringing butter, some vanilla in the gaiwan lid.
…

It’s been an aromatic delight for my nose… For the rest i am always happy with these typical FTM growing aftertastes, lining the mouth… and like all the LSD i’ve tried the shengjin is very effective and long lasting.

The energy was surprising, the taste pretty weak.
