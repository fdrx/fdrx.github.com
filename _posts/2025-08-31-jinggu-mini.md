Back in 2011 or 2012, I got that 100g mini beeng with lots of tea buds, but I can’t recall if I paid for it on a Taobao site I ordered from a few times, selling lots of white labels, or if it was a gift from a tea merchant in 2013, possibly from Malaysia, whose name I’ve forgotten. At that time, I know I tried the gifted mini beeng and thought it was pretty bad, like brewing tea with straw. Was it the same? I believe it’s more likely a tea I bought, given the following.

After the rinse, the wet leaves are slightly smoky but release a realistic leather aroma. The leather note fades quickly, leaving smoky and minty aromas on the gaiwan lid. In the mouth, it’s a bit astringent from the start, with just a touch of honey at first, then some bitterness, but the common thread during the session is a pleasant vinegar note that lingers on the palate and in the throat, evolving into a minty vinegar aftertaste. It’s quite enjoyable, it reminds me of some Lincang puerhs (Mangfei, Xigui). 

After a few brews, a rather strong tobacco flavor emerges, and the aftertaste continues to bloom nicely in the mouth and throat. I’m surprised! The tea can be pushed without any issue; it doesn’t become too strong or overly astringent, which is a plus. Later brews bring some Xiaguan medicinal notes; it’s pretty dynamic and evolving, with only the vinegar note and astringency persisting. 

I thought it wouldn’t be an enjoyable session, but I ended up fully focused on the tea. The slight astringency is a bit bothersome, but overall, it’s rather good. Later brews are smoky with fading minty vinegar, less impressive. It was a rather good surprise! I think it’s a 2011 Jinggu, probably not a gift. I’ll try to find the other mini beeng to compare it with.
