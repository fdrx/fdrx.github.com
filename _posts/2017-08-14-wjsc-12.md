maocha label: Wan jia shou cang 2012(?), unknown brand.
aromatic leaves (dry leaves: sour leather, gaiwan lid: santal , wet leaves: tobacco & maybe red fruits), tasteless soup at the beginning then anise, sweet & classic aftertaste that grows, has anise too. After 15 minutes the aftertaste is still there and in the mouth too: juicy, so cheeks constriction and salivation. Slow qi that makes me very clumsy and puts me in my bubble. Good surprise, that's what i like (unlike the mu shu cha of the other day)
