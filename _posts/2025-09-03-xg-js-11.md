That tea was called "turbo pu" back in 2011-12 since it was supposed to be a little shu-ish. Xiaguan was claiming it was made with 5-6 years old material. Who knows, but it was a rather cheap tea delivering a particular profile for a sheng. Personnally I did not have old puerh at this time, so i thought it had interesting kuwei flavors, even if was a simple xiaguan tea, very much like some of their bricks.

First brew make me feel think the tea remains unchanged, but after 2-3 brews some obvious some minty licorice is showing up, i don't remember it was the case when young.
Also a pretty strong energy comes quickly and abruptely. 
"Aged flavors" are less obvious than in my memory, it still has some strong bitter woody and medicinal flavors, there a hint of soap here and there, otherwise the licorice is pretty nice. But no humid forest or chicken coop flavors at all.
Huigan is not impressive but there is definitely some sweetness is returning in the throat but some sort of unpleasant astringency sits in the throat.
It's tasty but straightforward, licorice is good news, apart from that it's very xiaguan, which has its pros and cons. It's a bit unfortunate that the tea is a little harsh to the throat, but i don't have many teas with that profile so it's not bad to drink that from time to time.
Qi hitted quite hard, but i feel like i'm going to have some headache, so...
The aftertaste lasts quite long and is about sweet wood with a medicinal touch in the throat

It's not great nor super clean, but it has licorice, and I like particularely like licorice and chicken coop in puerh. But i feel pesticides might be part of that tea too!

Side note: it's giving me a curious envy of eating a toast with Foie Gras... I am not a big fan of foie gras, perhaps it would marry well with it?
