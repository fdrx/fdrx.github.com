I tried some 2010 CSH LBZ and it's an extremely clean tea with a very feminine vanilla flavor. Class A. I understand the "thin body" and the "no low note" concepts of shah82, but if think that this very clean taste is also rather "thick"... well it's just vacabulary, we all agree that's it's very good :wink:
