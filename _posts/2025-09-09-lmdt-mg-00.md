This tea didn’t leave a strong impression at first, let's see.

**Wet Leaves**: earthy yummy humid soil.\
**First Cup** is pretty hollow, woody then earthy. It triggers salivation immediately, leaving a distant aftertaste. Despite this, it’s very clean.\
**Second Cup**: I should’ve used more leaves. The flavor deepens slightly, but it remains hollow and lacks intensity.\
**Third Cup**: better, humid soil, barnyard notes coming.\
**Fourth Cup**: pushing the steeping time helps. The flavor is better now, with emerging mineral notes, though it still feels a bit thin.\
From the start, it offers good shengjin. Some caramel is coming alongside the classic shu pu’erh scents.\
**Fifth/Sixth Cup** cup: becomes distinctly mineral, with barnyard aromas and a hint of caramel lingering. Qi and aftertaste are weak.

**Overall**: This shu pu’erh is clean, free of off-putting aromas, with a pleasant mouthfeel and good shu aromas. However, it’s unusually thin and weak for a shu. Would make it a good choice for a shupu beginner.
