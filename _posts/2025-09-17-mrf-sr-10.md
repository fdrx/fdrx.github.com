Smelling those aromatic dry leaves is like a time machine back 13 years: the scent is identical, strawberry or forest fruit with a quiet leather base.

First cups bring strawberry and herbal notes, with a minty finish. Medium-bodied taste.
The tea hasn’t aged much; it’s mellower, but the flavor hasn’t evolved significantly.
The broth is pale, light yellow with a hint of red.

After half a dozen cups, a slight astringency hits the tip of the tongue, but it fades quickly.
The qi is quite noticeable but gentle.

The aftertaste is very fresh at the beginning of the session, with frozen strawberry notes, starting leathery then shifting to herbal-licorice vibes. Afterwards, after that the freshness fades but the aftertaste remains effective. That's the good part of the tea, and also it's pretty clean and unlikely a blend.

I don't have other teas with that profile, so it's okay, but there's nothing amazing or particularly inspiring about it to me.
