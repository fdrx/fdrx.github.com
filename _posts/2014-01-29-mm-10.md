it was a 2010 Manmai sample i bought several months ago, it smelled weird and i forgot it. I brewed it these days and i found a little something of seaweed that made the sips very mouth-watering and satisfactory... this was probably both enhanced by the minerals from the water i use (sodium?), and somewhat hidden by the tanins of the tea, but i really enjoyed this uncommon characteristic, like bad but delicious... and i did not even focus on the others aspects of the tea, except that the energy became much too burdensome after a while. But well, it's only a very personal return of experience, and the sample is over now...
