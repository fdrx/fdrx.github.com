Wet leaves: raspberries & herbal\
Gaiwan lid: lots of goodness during the session!

Well, it's very good from the start: vanilla, raspberries, orchid, hints of vinegar, sweetness, fresh bitterness

Huigans are very pronounced. The aftertaste is active immediately and is impressively long-lasting; it is sweet and fruity with a sort of fruity vinegar. Lots of malty feelings here and there.

After 7 or 8 brews, it starts fading and gives a comfortable orchid bitterness with honey brew. It is decently durable.

I realize the EOT Mr. Feng 2010 is probably a Bingdao, or something close, but not a memorable one based on my last [session](https://fdrx.github.io/sheng/2025/09/17/mrf-sr-10.html).

It is hard to beat a good Bingdao or Xigui, even if I would not drink that every day. They are very feminine and impressive teas. This one is not made of the most premium material but has been a treat since day 1, and it's aging nicely and taking depth. I had the chance to sample super premium Bingdaos a couple times in the past; this one is not of the same quality, but it is a good archetype!
