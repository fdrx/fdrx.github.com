Dry leaves: wood, hint of spices.\
Wet leaves: cigarette ash, Yiwu prunes, butter.

1st cup: butter, tapioca, raisins.\
Impressive, thick and clean. That was not so good 13-14 years ago, and I start feeling relaxed immediately.

2nd cup (pushed by mistake): same but with a floral component. Very nice aftertaste: Yiwu cream, raisins...

cups 3-4: caramel, tobacco, rather juicy now. Caramel huigan.\
When barely warm it's delicious, clearly when the soup is hot we miss the show.

Afterward it's getting more herbal and mineral. It tastes more like when young, still some butter though.

I'm feeling too satisfied and relaxed to continue taking notes. It was good, and I was expecting less.
The tea needs to be cooled.
