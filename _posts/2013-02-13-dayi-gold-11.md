You are correct, another Jin Dayi ’11 review…
Wet leaves aroma: burnt pine wood, thyme, a hint of leather
Taste: very particular. smoked taste, thyme, pepper, spices... not much chenwei for a ’11 dayi of this kind, or is it me? Tastes bada area plantations [Edit] blended with some mengsong/baotang [/Edit]
Huigan: yes… a few good “intoxicating” effects for a young sheng (if it means something...)
Aftertaste: sweet bitterness, smoke, a hint of garlic butter(?). Not very longlasting.
Mouthfeel: some astringency which doesn’t last too much, some slight salivation effect.
Soup: from gold yellow to orange
Qi: I have no idea… so, probably not much...maybe a bit of calming qi after a good while, i don't know
Nothing very refined in the taste, it’s thick & relatively complex, probably because it’s a blend; there are some good fast huigans and a decent sweet aftertaste in the throat… obviously designed to age perfectly it’s terribly boring as a young sheng and doesn’t taste good to me, at least for drinking now.

I bought a cake when it was $40, just because of all the hype. Now it’s $60 and I wouldn’t buy another bing at such a mystical price. I wonder why dayi didn’t make a nice shu bing of these leaves, maybe something like a higher quality dragon pole ?

I was a bit more inspired by the dayi longyin ‘12 but I need to try it again. It was more homogeneous and much more brewable, if I remember correctly.
