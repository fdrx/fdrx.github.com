Back in 2011 i remember that this Nannuo tasted really good, and was easy to drink. Let’s have a look after a few years of dry storage.

The broth is clean and oily. Almost no astringency will emerge during the session. The gaiwan lid smells santal wood, the wet leaves have chalk among others. The body has honey, later dark honey, an herbal element and something like sushi rice.

After 2–3 brews the herbal element gets wilder, but this change stays in the background and fades quickly during the session. Aftertaste has ripe banana and sushi rice, but it does not last long unlike an overall sweet and pleasant yun in the throat and the mouth.

After some brews the golden soup gets a little reddish and some minerality appears, and a discret smoke emerges. The aftertaste will get some of that nice and typical vinager and even a little something meaty.

Regarding the energy it warms the body and that’s pretty much all i would say.

It tastes good, nothing is brutal nor dominant. The shengjin is decent and the yun satisfactory.
