That was not a bet, just curiosity. It was 45 RMB back then, and today I think that was super expensive!

It was the worst pu'erh session I've ever made: it delivered a sort of awful purple bitterness that was even worse than when it was young.

That was not good, and it turned my stomach. I probably won't keep those 300-year-old leaves...
