After 4–5 years in an unopened terracotta jar, and in a rather cold and dry place, i’m having a grandpa session with a small chuck of Chenshenghao LBZ 2010.

The aromas from the glass are voodooing me, i will spend the day smelling this “leather and santal wood vinager”. The soup is pure and as expected, the length persists as long as a good expresso would do. The mouth gets oily after a while. Qi is obvious and makes me pretty euphoric but i am not focused on that.

This is a delicate drink, with lots of vanilla and some nice bitterness: as expected it has not aged that much compared to the two other bricks i kept with me, but at least it hasn’t become weak or anything like that.

LBZ or not, great or not, to me this is the kind of leaves that can make someone fall in love with puerh (depends on the chunk you pick though…), just like these ZhiZheng cakes did on me at the time.
