Yesterday i had some 09 douji BZ and i was surprised by the chocolate flavours and texture. The tea was excellent and with amazing durability, strong qi, but very different from all the others (supposed) LBZ i tried. It made me remind of the 07 guangbielaozhai from houde wich had chocolate too, if i remember well because it was some time ago...
(the wrappers of those 09 douji mini-bricks smell vanilla, it's weird)
