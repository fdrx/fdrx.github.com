Quanjihao manzhuan autumn '11 mini-brick:
clean & transparent broth, the wet leaves smell something floral & licorice root
Drinking this tea is like drinking hot water with a floral top taste, a milky mid one, and some herbaceous base. The floral element is not a high floral one, it's subtle like these big flowers that smell almost nothing
After sipping, a sweet aftertaste emerges from nowhere and coats the mouth progressively, and for a long while, that sweetness comes along with some of the floral note. low astringency, low bitterness, little shengjing, pretty flavourless but good huigan.
