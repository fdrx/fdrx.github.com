Sweet bulang with a distant bitterness. It has a pretty special profile, it can be borring sometimes but it certainly has the qualities of a clean tea: you will not feel any harshness, even when you push it.
Sweet tobacco with a floral touch and some anise here and there
Aftertaste is more located in the mouth and at the begginng of the throat.
Qi is rather long to come and on the meditative side. It affects the vision a bit. I feel it much more now than in the 10's! (most of my teas are like that, must be me...) 
what i don't like much about it is that it still has some soapy floral notes.
It has aged a bit, the soup is golden-orangy now.
Well it's a quality tea, the flavor profile is somewhat particular, but it's a sure bet for a relaxing session free of nazi face feelings.
