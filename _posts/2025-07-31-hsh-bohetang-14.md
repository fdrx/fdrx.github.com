Like drinking puerh with sugar for the first 3 brews. Too sweet.
Velvet puerh in the mouth, and you can brew it too much, it will remain good and clean.
Penetrating relaxing Qi, makes me keep the mouth closed.
Taidi teas can produce the same effects but along with agressivity, here it's pure and rounded.
Dies pretty fast though.

I'll have to make a deeper review in the future.
