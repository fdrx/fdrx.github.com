In the 80s, I was a little boy, and my grandmother started buying a tea that was supposed to help with weight loss. It wasn’t particularly good, but we got caught up in the excitement of drinking it every day, hoping to slim down. The expected effects didn’t really materialize, but the taste and packaging were so novel that they left a lasting impression on us, particularly on me. It was the Xiaguan XiaoFa, only exported to France at the time.

In 2007, my grandmother passed away, and two years later, for no apparent reason, I started buying puerh tea, about which I knew nothing, without making any connection to that childhood experience.

<p>
    Between 2009 and 2013 I was obsessed with puerh and I ended buying mucho too much of puerh! Also I tried to make puerh areas maps and list of villages on <a href="https://www.teachat.com/viewtopic.php?t=17948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">TeaChat</a> so that I could understand a bit more about that tea and its production areas. I hope it helped not only myself. ...talk about rivers (licang)??...talk about not reading chinese??

    Living in the paradise of coffee, I cheated on my puerh affair and slept in the coffee bed for years, but now it's time to revisit my beengs.

    The design’s a shameless nod to Medium (sorry, Medium, you’re just too inspiring!).
