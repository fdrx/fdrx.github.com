it was like 8 usd / 250g brick. It's probably not the healthiest puer ever pressed but it's not that bad actually: it's red and woody with these sort of whisky flavors, like in some aged dayi. The aftertaste is xiaguan-ish; some sweetness appears and some bitterness stays, which is not the best part. There is a a bit of astringency, but again that whisky taste profile is interesting, i hope this can age…
