Back in 2012, that was the kind of tea anyone would have liked in my opinion. I mean it was an easy drinker, like the ChenShengHao LaoBanZhang 2010, or, even more, any good Bingdao.

In my memory, that tea was from Menghai, perhaps a Banzhang tea, but now it seems quite obvious to me it’s a delicate Mengla tea. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any information about it, as I haven’t had much time to research, but I’ll try to find more information later.

Dry leaves: cocoa, paprika\
Wet leaves: like a Wangong or Guafengzhai area tea

Cup 1 & 2: orangey soup, mountain spring water texture, there is a nice little bitterness that transforms into something sweet immediately.\
Flavor-wise it was floral in the past, but that scent is transforming into an aged flavor, something delicate, still floral along with something sandalwood-like and overall medicinal. Well, the tea is aging very well! It's very clean and pretty delicious, and the aging process is impressive compared to most of the teas I've tried recently.\
Aftertaste is on the floral/herbal medicine side, saliva is promoted in a reasonable way. The aftertaste is very Mengla-ish to me.

Cup 3: bright acidity coming along with malty tobacco feelings, it's still overall a floral chenwei flavor. Sweet wood huigan.\
Cup 4: Qi is hitting since the end of cup 2, and makes me sleepy and a bit high, it's not brutal like BZ, it's insidious and not soft!\
Cup 5: a little bit more minty, aftertaste is blooming and is more malty with herbal notes, some licorice arrives after several minutes.\
Cup 6/7: woodier, having still very nice malty feelings.\
Cup 8: floral, slightly smoky, chenwei.\
Later brews: floral with hints of anise, distant bitterness, chen xiang... It's quite durable.

It was not simple to describe it because it's transitioning into an aged tea, but it's really cool to see those changes!
