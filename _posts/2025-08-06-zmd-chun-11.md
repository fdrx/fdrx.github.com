First brews: it seems like a typical Mengku area plantation tea, strong and aromatic, slightly floral, with huigan feelings, a bit astringent and pungent from the start, and it activates salivation. That said, I’m unsure if it’s a Mengku tea, a Menghai tea, or a blend. I vaguely recall it might be from Menghai, but that brand likely no longer exists, and I can’t find any trace of it. The soup is a bit orange, suggesting some aging.

It’s not a particularly pleasant puerh tea; I prefer more delicate ones, but with such strength, it should age well in a hot and humid environment. My rather dry storage is probably not ideal for this type of bold tea. The cha qi, or likely a caffeine rush, is very noticeable, and strop my agitation radically. After 3-4 brews, some herbal tobacco emerges along with a grainy background. It’s still quite pungent, but the sweetness balances the strength. Then a touch of licorice appears in the aftertaste, reminding me why I bought this tea in 2011. Unfotunately it’s ephemeral. Later brews are dull, no surprises here.

### Final Thoughts
Nothing remarkable, it's a strong and aromatic taidi tea that promotes salivation and has good length. It might not be super healthy but it is everything but bland.
