That was pretty muted and herbal back in the 2010s. I have a 250g beeng that should be of higher quality than this brick, which was quite cheap in the early 2010s.

Dark yellow-brown soup (like urine when you suffer dehydration lol). Very thick—thick like apricot juice.
Retro-olfactive feelings. Quick huigan after every sip.

Tastes like some Manzhuan/Manzhi mini bricks from QuanJiHao (权记号) that I had in the past.

I'm not sure how to describe that dark taste: dark honey, candied plum, laurel, and a hint of English breakfast. No bitterness, little astringency.

Aftertaste is on the milky side, with laurel, caramel, and a spice component. Not an everlasting aftertaste, though there is something in the background that remains for long. Persistent low astringency around the tongue.

Becomes mineral after some brews, still fruity and milky.

Qi is insidious, you think there isn't much, but in fact it's hitting, and not that softly.

latest brews are still thick, honey and a muted version of the taste, but not great

**Overall**: 
Very thick dark taste from Simao. Another world compared to the Bulangs profiles of this week. It makes me decide that the Bulang week is officially over.  Only 12 USD in the early 2010s, i wish I had another one.
