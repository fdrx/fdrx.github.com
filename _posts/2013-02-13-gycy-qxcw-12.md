Guangya QiXingChaWang 2012 (not DingJi... sorry for the confusion...)
Powerful qi! 10g in the gaiwan launch me into orbit. Is it from wuliang area? bangwei? somewhere else? [EDIT on 2014/03/05] very obvious Bulang... really bitter... qi not that strong this time... perhaps i was brewing the Dingji which is now an obvious mengla tea [/EDIT] Taste is only ok, makes my mouth oily and happy, great durability, fantastic tea i could buy at 40% of the regular price.
