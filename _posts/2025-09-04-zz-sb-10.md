Sweet bulang with a distant grapefruit bitterness. It has a rather special profile: sweet tobacco, a soapy floral touch, and some hints of anise here and there. It can be a bit boring sometimes but it certainly has the qualities of a clean tea: you will not feel any harshness nor discomfort, even when you push it. The aftertaste lingers mainly in the mouth and at the top of the throat.

Qi is rather long to come, and is on the meditative side. It affects the vision a bit. I feel it much more now than in the 10's! (most of my teas are like that, must be me...) 
what i don't like that much about it is that it still has some soapy notes and that it is not so dynamic.
It has aged a bit though, the soup is golden-orangy now, anise was not really present when it was young, if i remember correctly.

Well it's a quality tea, the flavor profile is particular, but it's a sure bet for a relaxing session free of nazi face feelings. We're far from a simple Xiaguan brick here.
Latest brews are pale yellow water with grapefruit or orange peel-like with some sweetness, pretty nice actually.
