XZH kuzhushan ’07 sample from Houde today. It tasted apricot flavored beer with some ersatz sourness. A good point is it delivers a very nice salivation effect that goes with some freshness, good mouthfeel. The bad point is for a 6 years old sheng there isn’t the slightest trace of age taste, so if you’re looking for a cake to store a few years in order to get some nice chenwei/umami i'm not shure it is worth spending $175 on this cake!
