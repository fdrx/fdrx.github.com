Dry Leaves: chocolate and vegetal tones.\
Wet Leaves: thyme-like aroma, slightly smoky, quite typical for a Bulang imo.

In 2011, this tea was barely drinkable, like Lao Man’e in strength (though not LME). Now, after aging, it’s mellowed out a lot.

First brew:
The initial punch from 2011 is gone. Vegetal notes linger, not quite thyme but a similar aromatic herb.
Strong cacao flavors show up, with sweet grapefruit undertones.
Sweet and pleasant, with obvious huigan right from the start. Subtle tobacco in the aftertaste.

Second & third cups:
Some greenness remains, but it’s rounded with low astringency that increases slightly over time.
Mouthfeel turns oily and fresh after a few minutes. Aftertaste has thyme-like notes, and tobacco.
Surprisingly less bitter than the 2010 Zhi Zheng Bulang Peak I tried recently.

Fourth brew:
The qi hits suddenly, with a vibe similar to the Zhi Zheng. These teas were worlds apart in 2011, but now they share some traits: qi, grapefruit tones, oily clean broth. Still some greenness. Astringency stays rather low. Oily, fresh mouthfeel, salivation increasing. 

Fifth cup:
Some cacao flavors. The cha qi is intense, felt throughout the body. The soup shows bubbles after pouring, giving a lively texture

This tea has aged quietly but nicely. The greenness is still there but fading, and it will likely get even better with time.
Got tea drunk after six cups—didn’t see that coming! 

Later brews have that thyme-like flavor and some sort of honey sweetness, it's a bit boring.
