The tea from [Yunnan Sourcing](https://yunnansourcing.com/) is rather thick and oily in mouth, it has some energy that weakens/calms for sure. It produces some astringency that is more or less hidden by a creamy mouthfeel and the salivation promotion.

The bitterness is definitely present and lasts, but is not over potent; what also lasts is the minerality in the mouth, and it’s is not very pleasant. Overall the taste is not great: it has spicy/wild notes, bitterness, some mushrooms with a hint of vanilla.

It’s a good quality tea, but the taste is too mineral and bitter. When this fades, some sugarcane & woody notes set at the top of the throat, but not for so long. The shengjin remains good and dynamic.

Eventually, its name suits him well.
