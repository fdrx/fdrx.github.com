(...) actually I only have a yibi cake from this brand: it's rather tasty and juicy with slight wild notes, nice aftertaste in mouth, some astringency... not bad.... The wet leaves turn black rather quickly though.
It's maybe a little bit like a younger and greener douji 05 red.... maybe not...
I'd like to try the sanheshezhai bing to compare with this yibi. i've also tried a couple of samples from this brand, the yishanmo was interesting if i remember correctly.
