Another expensive one that was full of chocolate when i sampled it... (it was also half the price) : QiXing 2011
the first review ever of any GuangYa
I hope GuangYa people are going to send me a free beeng for that! :lol:
Iâ€™d pick their 1Kg brick wich is so good : yiwu(?) full of juice and anise... maybe this can turn a bit too much "abricot marmelade", i don't know unfortunalty, but if not, that will be seriously good.
