First brews: it seems to be a typical Mengku area plantation tea: very strong and aromatic, a bit floral, huigan feelings, a bit astringent and pungent since the start, activates the salivation. That being said, i dont' know if it's a mengku tea, and it might also be some sort of menghai area tea, or a blend. I have a sort of memory it could be from menghai, but that brand is probably dead since a long time and i cannot find anything on it. soup is orange.

Well it's not a super pleasant puerh teas for me, i prefer more delicate teas, but with such a strength it should age well in hot and humid environment. My rather dry storage is probably not the best conditions for this kind of teas.
Cha Qi or more probably the cafeine rush is more than obvious. I can't move nor open the mouth, so to speak.
after 3-4 brews some herbal tobacco arrives along with a semolina background, it's still pretty pungent but the sweetness compensates the strength. An then arrives a bit of licorice in the aftertaste, which makes me remember why i bought that tea in 2011.
later brews are borring, no miracle here.

### Final Thoughts
Nothing remarkable here, it's a strong and aromatic taidi tea that promotes salivation and has good length. Probably not super healthy wither, but everything but bland.
