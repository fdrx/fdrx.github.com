In the 80s, I was a little boy, and my grandmother started buying a tea that was supposed to help with weight loss. It wasn’t particularly good, but we got caught up in the excitement of drinking it every day, hoping to slim down. It did not work but the taste and packaging were so novel that they left a lasting impression on us, particularly on me. It was the Xiaguan XiaoFa, only exported to France at the time.

    In 2007, my grandmother passed away, a few months later my grandfather as well, and in 2009, on a wild whim, knowing absolutely nothing about it, I started collecting puerh tea, about which I knew nothing, and built a rather decent collection without making any connection to that childhood experience.

<p>
    Between 2009 and 2013 I became obsessed with puerh and I wanted to taste and understand everything about it, so I started to sample all the tea I could and made maps and lists of puerh areas on <a href="https://www.teachat.com/viewtopic.php?t=17948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">TeaChat</a>. I did not know anything about Chinese, but I got passionate about that activity for some time. I'm sure it helped others too, despite likely some mistakes and omissions.

    Living in a paradise for coffee beans, I cheated on my puerh affair and slept in the coffee bed for years, but now it's time to revisit my beengs!
