I had a sample of this XZH 06 from houde, i think it was the black wrapper. i must confess that i didn't like it: too much wildness for me i think... after several brews the tea was very interesting (salivation effect, oily mouth,...) but the first brews were almost a pain for me to drink, and the qi wasn't stellar. so i'm not surprised by what you say, even if some people seem to like this cake for good reasons too.
