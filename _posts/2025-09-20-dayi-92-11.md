Quick session today.

It's a 100g brick. I liked it in 2011 and it was cheap (40 rmb), so I bought 6. I'm curious to see how it does.

The wet leaves smell like young Dayi sheng; they don't say much.
The soup is amber.

Well, it tastes very Bada to me, though it's probably a blend. It's very rounded and the flavors are quite difficult to describe.
The first cups have semolina, honey, a fruity touch, and a leather touch. After that: honey, some hints of fennel, hints of mushrooms. It's not very well defined though.

Almost no bitterness, no harshness either. Some astringency shows up halfway through the session. The young version was a little aggressive, not anymore. Also it's decently oily in mouth too. Qi is gentle.

The aftertaste is quite efficient but flavorless. After many minutes, it's menthol-ish and something between anise and licorice defines itself.

I liked it, it's not a "grand cru" but it's rounded and comfortable. It might not be at its peak moment though. Let's go back to it later.
