Qilinhao lbz '11 or '12 (sample):
bitter but not undrinkable. very much like the idea we have of lao man'e. there's some good vanilla along with the bitterness and the mushrooms. A discret pleasant smoke appears after a few brews. Not astringent, not very creamy either. A little juicy after a while, makes salivate a bit. The aftertaste stays in the mouth too, and for a rather long time. some freshness in the mouth. I haven't noticed any particular qi. a rather classic bitter bulang. Not my thing.
