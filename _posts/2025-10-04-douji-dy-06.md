I regret what I said [here](https://fdrx.github.io/sheng/2025/09/14/douji-stds-05.html). It's actually becoming a good tea.
It has some qualities that would perhaps make it not that cheap today: it's pure and clean thus unblended, and it is aging slowly but nicely.

That tea used to be boring, yes, but its past monotony is starting to vibrate now, taking a liquorous and earthy direction. 
It's not shining for its aftertaste, clearly, but because its evolution, pure and transparent, and since it is not hiding anything, it allows to follow its evolution without any interference. A sort of mini open-book on aging puerh.

Dry leaves: hot chocolate and paprika\
First brews have almond, cream and a guava or curuba finish, with a hint of tobacco.\
Quickly the top note is transitioning into a liqueur note, which makes the whole more bright and juicy. There is still some guava and nice tobacco notes.\
The aftertaste has milk and curuba (banana passionfruit)\
Some chen xiang and hints of mint/licorice arrive along with those liqueur notes, and they are durable.\
When pushed, the brews bring lots of sweetness and can be yummy. I can feel some earthy notes being born too.

It's getting interesting with age, and 14 years ago, I was buying puerh to have moments like that, when you can taste a bit of the puerh magic.
