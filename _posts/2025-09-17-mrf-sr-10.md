Smelling those aromatic dry leaves is like a time machine back 13 years: the scent is identical, strawberry or forest fruit with a quiet leather base.

First cups bring strawberry and herbal notes, with a minty finish. Medium-bodied taste.
The tea hasn’t aged much; it’s mellower, but the flavor hasn’t evolved significantly.
The broth is pale, light yellow with a hint of red.

After half a dozen cups, a slight astringency hits the tip of the tongue, but it fades quickly.

The aftertaste is very fresh after the first cups, with frozen strawberry notes, starting leathery then shifting to herbal-licorice vibes. That's the good part of the tea.

Qi is noticeable but gentle.

I don't have others teas with that profile, so it's ok, but there is nothing amazing nor very particularly inspiring to me.
