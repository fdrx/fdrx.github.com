I regret what I said [here](http://127.0.0.1:4000/sheng/2025/09/14/douji-stds-05.html). It's actually an interesting tea.
It has some qualities that would perhaps make it not that cheap today: it's pure and clean thus unblended, and it is aging slowly but nicely.
That tea was boring, yes, but the monotomy of the past is slightly vibrating now, and it's taking an licorous and earthy direction. 
The tea is clearly not shinning for its aftertaste, it's shinning because it's changing in a good way, and it is not hidding anything, so it allows us to follow its evolution without any interference. A sort of mini opened-book on aging puerh.

Dry leaves: hot chocolate and paprika

First brews have almond, cream and a guava finish, with hint of tobacco.\
Quickly the top note is transitioning into a liqueur note, which make the whole more brigth and juicy. There is still somt guava and nice tobacco notes.
The aftertaste has milk and curuba (banana passionfruit)
Some mint and touches of licorice and chen xiang arrive along with those liqueur notes and the whole is decently durable.
When pushed the brews bring lots of sweetness and can be yummy

It's getting interesting with ageness, and 14 years ago, I was buying puerh to have moments like that, when you can see a bit of the puerh magic.
