The first three brews are bold but fairly straightforward.

Then it turns sheng-like and really shines: sweet and minty aftertaste that makes the whole cavity happy. It gives me a “tea high” pretty quickly.

The aftertaste is strong in both the mouth and throat, with malt and mint. It reminds me of last week’s Mangfei: after a while, it fades quickly, leaving a pleasant sweet vinegar note, like the scent on a gaiwan lid.

It’s sweet, slightly earthy, and packed with sheng pu’er flavors.

I enjoy the Dragon Pole ’10/’11, but this one is better and more consistent. I wouldn’t be surprised if its yumminess comes from a blend of Mangfei or Xigui area leaves, for their pleasant flavors and bold aftertaste, mixed with stronger Menghai tea like Bulang. Laugh if you want, but eventually it makes me think of a shu version of the almost-too-sweet HuiShengHao Bohetang ’14.

Unlike sheng pu’er, I feel like gentle dry storage is exactly what this kind of tea needs.

The later brews are hot water with chicken coop aromas, which I really enjoy. Given how much tea I have, it’s not so common for me to push a session this far. Those late brews remind me of the better chunks of the Dragon Pole ‘10/’11, a tea that can be hit-or-miss. I also recall the ’05 version being a hit for its chicken coop notes, but it was much pricier, I should try it one of these days.

Very satisfying tea session !!
