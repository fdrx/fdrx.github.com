YS Mu Shu Cha 2011, grandpa style
Almost zero aroma compared to yesterday LBZ
Pretty tasteless too, all is in the aftertaste which is quite strong. It starts sweet and becomes minty after a while. Length is decent.
Quite astringent.
The soup is clean, but since the first sip i am filling pesticides in the throat and tongue (i can be wrong though)
Some bitterness is showing up on round two
Energy is obvious, i start focused on my stomach and i am feeling a bit high after a few minutes, and i'll be like that for a good while, but my mind is not trying to do thousands of things at the same time like with the LBZ. Later i can feel my eyes too, well i can feel some energy in the body... strong calming energy, not class A to me but it is strong. (note that i am not drinking much puerh recently)
too astringent for now.
